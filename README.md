# Flash_Feedback
An application that lets users sign up and log in to their own accounts. Once logged in, users can add feedback, edit their feedback, delete their feedback, and see a list of all feedback that they’ve given. Many of these routes should be protected, so that for example user1 can’t edit a piece of feedback that user2 created.
